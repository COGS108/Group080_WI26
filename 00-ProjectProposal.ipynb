    "The way we search for information online is going through a huge change right now. For about 30 years, Google and other search engines worked pretty simply: you typed in a question, and they gave you a list of websites to click on. This \"Ten Blue Links\" model meant that users had to do the work of clicking through different sites, reading them, and figuring out what was true on their own.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) But now, with AI being added to search engines, things are different. Instead of just showing you where to find answers, search engines are now trying to give you the answer directly. Researchers call this shift moving from \"Information Retrieval\" to \"Generative Information Retrieval.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This change didn't happen overnight, it built up over several years. In 2015, Google started using something called RankBrain, which was the first time they used deep learning to understand search queries better. Then in 2019, they added BERT (which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which helped Google understand words in the context of a full sentence instead of just individually.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) In 2021, they introduced MUM (Multitask Unified Model), and finally in 2023, they launched the Search Generative Experience (SGE), which became \"AI Overviews\" in 2024. This was the first time Google actually showed AI-generated text at the top of search results instead of just links.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "One major consequence of this shift is what researchers call the \"Great Decoupling\"—basically, more people are searching than ever, but fewer people are actually clicking through to websites. The numbers are pretty striking: about 60% of Google searches now end without the user clicking on anything (this goes up to 77% on phones).<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) A study by Seer Interactive found that when an AI Overview shows up, click-through rates for the top search results dropped from 1.41% to just 0.64%—that's more than a 50% decrease.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) Another study from Ahrefs found that AI Overviews reduce organic clicks by around 58%, and it's getting worse over time, not better.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the economic impact on websites, there are also concerns about whether these AI-generated answers are actually reliable. When you see a list of links, you know you need to evaluate them yourself. But when an AI gives you a direct answer, it can seem more trustworthy than it actually is—researchers call this the \"Illusion of Neutrality.\"<a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a>[<sup>7</sup>](#cite_note-7) This is a problem because users might accept AI-generated summaries without questioning them the way they would with regular search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "One specific issue is that AI systems can \"hallucinate,\" which means they sometimes make up information that sounds believable but is completely wrong. There have been cases where AI summaries cited satirical articles as if they were real news, or made up citations that don't exist.<a name=\"cite_ref-8\"></a>[<sup>8</sup>](#cite_note-8) On top of that, research from Stanford has found that AI models like Gemini can have political biases built into them based on the data they were trained on and the people who helped fine-tune them.<a name=\"cite_ref-9\"></a>[<sup>9</sup>](#cite_note-9)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some researchers have started creating tools to test and evaluate these AI search systems. The C-SEO Bench dataset is a benchmark for testing how different writing styles affect whether content shows up in AI-generated answers.<a name=\"cite_ref-10\"></a>[<sup>10</sup>](#cite_note-10) Salesforce also created something called the Answer Engine Eval framework, which measures things like how well AI answers cover a topic and whether the citations they provide are actually reliable.<a name=\"cite_ref-11\"></a>[<sup>11</sup>](#cite_note-11) However, there haven't been many long-term studies that compare how search behavior and information quality have changed since AI Overviews were introduced. This is the gap we want to explore with our research. \n",

    "    >Browser extension panels and SEO tool data likely introduce collection bias. These sources tend to oversample tech-savvy users, marketing professionals, and desktop users while underrepresenting mobile-first users and less technical populations.
